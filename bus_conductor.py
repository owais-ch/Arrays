BUS CONDUCTOR (GFG)
You are conductor of a bus .There are n chairs and n passengers in the bus. You are given an array chairs of length n, where chairs[i] is the position of the ith chair. You are also given the array passengers of length n, where passengers[j] is the position of the jth passenger.

You may perform the following move any number of times:

Increase or decrease the position of the ith passenger by 1 (i.e., moving the ith passenger from position x to x + 1 or x - 1)
Return the minimum number of moves required to move each passenger to a chair such that no two passengers are in the same chair and every passenger gets a chair.

Note that there may be multiple chairs or passengers in the same position at the beginning.

Example 1:

Input: 
chairs = [3,1,5] 
passengers = [2,7,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The passengers are moved as follows:
- The first passenger is moved from position 2 to position 1 using 1 move.
- The second passenger is moved from position 7 to position 5 using 2 moves.
- The third passenger is moved from position 4 to position 3 using 1 move.
In total, 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 moves were used.

class Solution:
    def findMoves(self,n,chairs,passengers):
        chairs.sort()
        passengers.sort()
        
        total=0
        
        for i in range(n):
            total+=abs(chairs[i]-passengers[i])
            
        return total
